# autoTicTakToeGame
In this game, you can play Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer. The computer will make its moves using a simple algorithm and the "Math.random()" function.

The algorithm is simple:  
1. First, check if the computer can win; if so, play the winning move.  
2. Second, check if the user can win in the next move; if so, block it.  
3. Third, play in the center if available.  
4. Fourth, choose a corner if available.  
5. Finally, make a random move.
